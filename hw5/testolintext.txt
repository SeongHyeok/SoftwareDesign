Olin's outstanding educational environment is a unique mix of exceptional students, faculty and facilities, combined with a pioneering approach to engineering education. Olin's faculty consists of nationally recognized scholars and researchers from top institutions with a deep commitment to undergraduate teaching.

Our students are some of the most academically gifted and enterprising engineering candidates in the country. Our facilities are state-of-the-art, and built to stay that way. Our curriculum represents the most advanced and innovative thinking about how to produce technological leaders who are both creative and entrepreneurial.

Partnerships with Boston-area colleges enhance this learning environment. A formal collaborative relationship exists with nearby Babson College, ranked number one nationally in entrepreneurship, and with Wellesley College, one of the country's leading liberal arts institutions. Together we are exploring new, interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving.
